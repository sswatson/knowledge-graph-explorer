# Knowledge Graph Explorer

This project contains a React component that can be used to explore a graph view of a RelationalAI knowledge graph.

## Developer Setup

This directory is structured as a pnpm monorepo with two packages:

- `packages/example`. A simple example of how to use the React component.
- `packages/library`. The React component itself.

To get started, do `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev` from the root dirctory of the project. This will start a development server for the example app, and it will recompile the library package when its source files are saved.
